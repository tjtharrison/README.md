## Employment History

<span class="green">Smart Pensions (January 2025 - Present) Principal Security Engineer:</span> I have maintained my responsibilites from my previous role as DevSecOps | DevEx Tech Lead, with additional responsibilities for the wider security of the Smart Pensions estate.

I have taken on the responsibility of managing the security of the Smart Pensions estate, including the implementation of security observability across the Smart Pensions cloud infrastructure, ensuring that all cloud tooling has appropriate security monitoring in place so that the appropriate team is alerted to any issues that may arise. 

This has included consulting with various teams across the business to ensure that the appropriate security tooling and processes are in place for their services.

I have recently delivered an initiative to deliver a process for threat modelling across the Smart Pensions estate, including delivering tooling and processes to allow teams to easily threat model their services and ensure that appropriate mitigations are in place for any identified risks.

I am heavily involved in our audit and compliance processes, including working with our external auditors to ensure that we are compliant with our security policies and procedures. This has included delivering ISO27001 compliance and currently working towards SOC2 compliance.

<span class="green">Smart Pensions (September 2022 - January 2025) DevSecOps | DevEx Tech Lead:</span> I lead a DevSecOps | DevEx team focusing on improving Security of the Smart Pensions environment through implementation and improvement of tooling and processes, while also improving the developer experience and relationship with security teams across the engineering community.

I have lead the deployment of GitHub Advanced Security across a GitHub Enterprise account, ensuring full coverage of tooling and supporting processes and documentation were in place to "shift left" security responsibility to the owning development teams with appropriate automated escalation of longstanding issues to the engineering management team.

I have also lead the team to implement Security observability across the Smart Pensions cloud infrastructure, ensuring that all cloud tooling has appropriate security monitoring in place so that the appropriate team is alerted to any issues that may arise. This has involved threat modelling, writing custom monitoring and runbooks for our monitors in Datadog and ensuring that the right team is aware of the alerts and how to respond to them.

I am continuing to improve and assist on the infrastructure security on AWS writing Terraform modules and using AWS Tooling (AWS Security Hub, AWS Config, AWS Guardduty) as well as other platforms (GitHub, Cloudflare, Dnsimple) to highlight non-compliance and issues that present a risk to the Smart Pensions estate. 

I am building a single plane of glass approach to monitoring - Consolidating SCM, infrastructure and AppSec alerting into Datadog, using Datadog security functionality to aggregate and triage alerting to the appropriate owning team.

I have taken on additional responsibilities as the DevEx Tech Lead, focusing on improving the Developer Experience across the Smart Pensions estate. This split responsibility has given me valuable insight into both leading a team with different stakeholders, as well as a different perspective on the wider engineering team's requirements.

My team has taken stewardship of GitHub, Cloudflare and aspects of AWS and provide "platform as a service" to the wider engineering team. By configuring all aspects of the cloud that we manage (including GitHub Actions, Workflows, GHAS, Audit Logging, Branch Protection, Code Owners etc) to be defined as IAC in Terraform to improve auditability and compliance on changes as well as ease of use. 

My team completed a migration of all CI/CD pipelines from Semaphore CI to GitHub Actions, with the aim to consolidate all CI/CD pipelines into a single platform as well as reducing spend on CI/CD.

I have driven cost saving initiatives across our Cloud estate, including migrating to GitHub self hosted runners, improved observability of spend across the estate and improved tagging of resources to allow for better cost allocation.

I have lead the development of a slack based tool to resolve a longstanding issue across engineering to communicate changes to the wider business. This has allowed a frictionless way for developers to easily communicate changes to the wider business and ensure that the appropriate stakeholders are informed of changes that may impact them, as well as providing a searchable history of changes that have been made.
