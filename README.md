## Key Leadership Skills

<span class="green">Team Leadership:</span> I have 4 years leadership experience with varying levels of technically skilled team members, requiring leadership skills (technical growth, specialising etc). I have worked leading Infrastructure, DevOps and Development teams in both Kanban and Scrum methodologies and am a strong believer in supporting principals for Agile development.

<span class="green">Mentorship:</span> I take pride in working with all members of the team to improve their technical understanding and confidence.

<span class="green">Documentation:</span> In all teams I have lead, I have built up a strong collection of documentation based on projects and applications we have built as a team, runbooks for routine tasks, internal processes / ways of working and diagrams for implemented solutions.
