<h3 class="md">DevSecOps Tech Lead</h3>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><span class="green">Aim: </span>To use my technical expertise and excellent communication skills to help lead a team achieve success.</p>
<p>A self-motivated team player with experience in heavily technical and client facing account management roles. An excellent communicator (both written and verbal) and have an ability to form close relationships with internal team and external shareholders.</p>
<p>I have a strong technical background working in Fintech and a proven understanding of Cloud native Infrastructure (AWS, Security, Kubernetes, Datadog, GitHub - More details below). I have ability to make strategic decisions under time and budget constraints and execute reliably.</p>
<h2>Key Leadership Skills</h2>
<p><span class="green">Team Leadership:</span> I have 4 years leadership experience with varying levels of technically skilled team members, requiring leadership skills (technical growth, specialising etc). I have worked leading Infrastructure, Security, DevOps and Development teams in both Kanban and Scrum methodologies and am a strong believer in supporting principals for Agile development.</p>
<p><span class="green">Mentorship:</span> I take pride in working with all members of the team to improve their technical understanding and confidence. I also  volunteer on <a href="https://cybermentordojo.com/">Cyber Mentor Dojo</a>, helping others starting out on their Security careers to focus their learning and answer any questions (technical or career specific).</p>

<p><span class="green">Documentation:</span> In all teams I have lead, I have built up a strong collection of documentation based on projects and applications we have built as a team, runbooks for routine tasks, internal processes / ways of working and diagrams for implemented solutions. I find this is the most efficient way to onboard new team members and help existing team members gain experience with new services. I am proficient in writing sequence diagrams to help explain technical solutions to a wider audience within the company.</p>
<h2>Key Technical Skills</h2>
