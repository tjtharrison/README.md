<p><span class="green">Proactive Threat Intelligence:</span> I regularly review emerging threats and IOCs for various attack vectors, such as the recent npm hack, and proactively build detections to ensure robust pre-emptive coverage across our cloud estates.</p>

<p><span class="green">Security Observability:</span> Led the implementation of security observability across our cloud infrastructure, consolidating SCM, infrastructure, and AppSec alerts into a single pane of glass. Recently led the migration of our primary security posture from Datadog to Wiz. Used this tooling to remediate high profile vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, with a focus on improving our overall security posture.</p>

<p><span class="green">Incident Response:</span> I have extensive experience at leading high severity incidents, including communication to senior members of staff, detailed timelines and incident reporting (retrospective). I am adept at working with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to help identify and triage security incidents.</p>

<p><span class="green">Security Automation:</span> Took ownership of and drove the full implementation of GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) for an Enterprise account of 300 developers (including writing of custom secret scanning patterns and deployment of workflows to all org repositories). Deployed various security tools and automations to automate repetitive security tasks, improving the security posture of the environment and reducing manual toil.</p>

<p><span class="green">Threat Modelling:</span> Delivered a comprehensive threat modelling initiative across the company, providing teams with the tooling and processes to identify and mitigate risks.</p>

<p><span class="green">Cost Savings:</span> Drove cost-saving initiatives by migrating CI/CD pipelines to GitHub Actions and implementing self-hosted runners, reducing cloud spend and improving resource tagging for better cost allocation.</p>

<p><span class="green">Internal Tooling:</span> Developed a custom Slack-based tool to resolve a longstanding engineering communication issue, creating a frictionless way for developers to communicate changes to the wider business.</p>
